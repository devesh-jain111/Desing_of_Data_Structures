# üìö Data Structures Project Showcase

## üìå Overview
This repository contains **10 real-world inspired Data Structure projects** designed for engineering students.  
The goal is to **apply theory to practice**, gain **hands-on coding skills**, and build an **interview-ready portfolio**.

Students are required to **choose any 3 projects** from the list and implement them in **C, C++, or Python**.  
Each project focuses on **different core data structures and algorithms**.

## üìå Instructions for Students
1. **Choose any 3 projects** from the list.
2. Implement them in **C, C++, or Python**.
3. Create **a separate GitHub repository for each project**:
   - Place source code in a `src` folder.
   - Add a `README.md` explaining the project, features, and how to run it.
   - Include screenshots or sample output.
4. Submit your GitHub link in class excel sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zuVR33UhpJSZNUHauebuIxXRMfHrptnq3OySAuWiYbM/edit?usp=sharing)
